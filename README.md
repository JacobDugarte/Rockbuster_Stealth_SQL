Rockbuster is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. They are facing competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime so the Rockbuster Stealth management team plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company once known for its physical stores worldwide, is grappling with the challenges posed by the digital streaming era.
